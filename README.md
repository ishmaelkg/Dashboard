# Dashboard
Group13 Dashboard for Assignment 2


Zimbabwe COVID-19 Task Force was commissioned to inform the Zimbabwean populace  how the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the world. Whilst the comparison with the whole world was required, it was particularly important to share statistics within and among SADC countries. Better still, Covid-19 in Zimbabwe would be the gist of having this dashboard to see how as a country we are faring with this fatal disease. 
        
Good Health, a research comapny decided to come up with a dashboard to assist with statistics on Covid-19 which the Zimbabwe Task Force would make use of for references. This is the beginning of the design of the Covid-19 dashboard.

The statistics contained in this project are superficial and not official but were used to make a foundation for the Dashboard Application.
